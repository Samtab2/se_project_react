# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.



Consistency with Design:
Double-check all visual elements against the Figma design.
Ensure spacing, font sizes, colors, and alignments are consistent.

Responsiveness:
Test the layout on various screen sizes and devices to ensure it looks good on all of them.
Use Chrome DevTools to simulate different devices.

Performance:
Check the website's load time using tools like Google Lighthouse.
Optimize images and other assets.


Accessibility:
Use accessibility tools in Chrome DevTools to ensure your website is accessible to all users.
Make sure you have proper ARIA labels, alt texts for images, and keyboard navigability.

Functionality:
Verify that all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) work as intended.
Test user authentication (sign-in, sign-out, and profile updates) thoroughly.

Error Handling:
Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.
Handle network errors gracefully and provide user feedback.

Cross-Browser Compatibility:
While Chrome is your primary development browser, also test in Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Postman Tests:
Confirm that all API endpoints are functioning correctly.
Validate response data and handle any errors properly in your application.

Code Quality:
Run a code linting tool to check for any code quality issues.
Ensure your code follows best practices and is well-documented.
